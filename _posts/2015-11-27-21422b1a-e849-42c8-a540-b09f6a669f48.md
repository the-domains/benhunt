Frustrations with "The Grid"

I can't say I've done a deep dive into what the Grid can do.

There are certainly some usability challenges, which are obvious to a new user. Maybe it's one of those "Read the Manual" things, but as everyone knows there are only two major rules to the usability of manuals:

1\. Users don't read manuals.

2\. Unless they're already in big trouble.

That means, never rely on your users to read up before they just dive on in and start trying to make things happen.

That's certainly what I've done, and I've stumbled and I've hit walls.
